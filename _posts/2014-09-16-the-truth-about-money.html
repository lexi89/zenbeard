<p >People tend to fall in one of two camps: “money is good” or “money is bad”.</p>
<p >The <em>"money is bad"</em> folk see people with lots of money as dishonest and snake-like. The assumption is that they have stepped on people to get there and they spend money on meaningless crap. Some common expressions from this camp: "<em>more for me is less for you</em>", "<em>making a profit is unethical</em>", "<em>hoarding money is selfish</em>".</p>
<p >People in "<em>money is good</em>" have no problem making and chasing money. Typically because it will bring them self-worth and status in the eyes of friends and family. The mechanic is: if I have "x" amount of money, I will be able to have "y" and "z". Security, a holiday, a house, a new car, proof that I have truly "made it". They want money and it will make them happy when they have enough of it.</p>
<p >Well, let me drop a truth bomb on your ass. <em>Both are bullshit</em>.</p>
<h2 >Money is a "magnifier".</h2>
<p >Money by itself is completely neutral. Obviously. It's a number on a screen, or a face on some metal or paper. The way you interpret it is entirely up to you.</p>
<p >It's tempting to look at people with bulging pockets as nothing short of SELFISH BASTARDS, but hear me out.</p>
<p >All money does is magnify you and your character. If you are an idiot, then a lot of money will just make you a <em>bigger idiot</em>. If you are a miser, then money will make you a <em>tighter miser</em>. If you are generous, then money will make you <em>more generous</em>.</p>
<p >If you say it's evil, it's evil. If it's good, then, to <em>you</em>, it's good.</p>
<h2 >Case in point...</h2>
<p><a href="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/10-lottery-burnouts.htm#page=1" target="_blank">Look at your average joe lottery winner</a>. All of these silly sausages are in the "money is good" camp (that's why they bought a lottery ticket in the first place). At last, the financial hurdle between them and their dream life - houses, cars, boats, gambling, drugs, and boats - was removed. Predictably, all of them ended up exactly where they were before the winnings: on benefits, bankrupt, in prison, or rehab. Or dead. All money did was magnify their desire for shiny things without working for it.</p>
<p >Summarised very well by one of these self-made victims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p >"I only started to think about three things -- drugs, sex and gold. The dealer who introduced me to crack has more of my lottery money than I do"</p>
</blockquote>
<p >So what happens if you get your shit together before you rise to fortunes? Well, <em>that's the sweet spot</em>, my friend. These are the real movers and shakers of the world you won't hear about in the media because they're too busy pushing the world forward not backward.</p>
<p >Everyone on this list <span style="text-decoration: underline;">figured out what change they wanted to make</span> before they set off to get the money for it. They knew what they would do with the money when they get it. The "<em>why?</em>" came first.</p>

<p >Point is this: <em>money is neither good nor bad</em>. It is entirely up to you what you do with it because it's just a tool. Like a hammer. Do you run around grumbling about how hammers can hurt people do you? No. You put up shelves and hooks and shit.</p>
<p >The news will say that a diet of cocaine and prostitutes is inevitable for rich folk. Not the case. Money has and will continue to be used as a tool for positive change so bring it on.</p>
<p >Idiots with money make good headlines. Leaders with money make change.</p>
<p >What do you want to be? A headline or a change-maker?</p>
