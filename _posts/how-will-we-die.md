A Tale Of Porn, Games, And Death

research: http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying

There's this deeply insightful book and series of articles written by a a palliative nurse called Bonnie, who, among other things, would comfort people as they die.

She documented all the things people regret not doing and when you read it, it becomes clear that what we think of as a successful life isn't like that at all.

Here the 5 most common regrets of the dying:

1.  I wish I had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the lives others expected of me.
2. I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
3. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.

Notice how there isn't a single thing on here about "changing the world" or leaving a legacy, or any other entrepreneurial poop. A topic for another time, perhaps...

# I was completely hooked on games and porn

In my late teens and early twenties, there wouldn't be a single day without games or porn.

Somehow, these stories found their way into my life and, naturally, I started thinking: *If that was me, what would I regret?* 

I imagined regretting spending all this time gaming.

And never experiencing real relationships.

And experiencing life on a screen.

And never *trying*.

Admitting these things felt like coming out of a hypnosis or waking up after a long sickness. A total, full-body relief. 

# What will the digital generation regret on their deathbed?

Here's another thought. The top 5 regrets of the dying was a study on people dying *today*. These are people who grew up without the internet, without archives of porn at their fingertips, without the instant comparison against other. 

Imagine what *our* generation's regrets will be and it becomes very clear the kind of things we simply *have to* drop.

I wish I didn't bother with those games

I wish I spent more time offline

I wish I saw nature in reality

What do you think *we* will say? 

The generation that is dying now did not have: computers & screens, games consoles, access to pornography,  

I believe our generation has to be more vigilant and we must innoculate ourselves against all the things and people who will convince us to give up our time and our decision power. 

# It is healthy to think about dying

Steve Jobs touched on it in his famous speech, but it's a whole different ballgame to really let the words sink in and *feel* what it means. 

It is healthy to ask yourself if you will regret spending a particular chunk of time on something.

Just asking the questions is a reminder to yourself that you want to live a juicy and full life. That you really *do* want to squeeze the most out of it. 

It's never too late to start. If you're carrying baggage, it will become part of your story and a useful message for next generations.

I hope if you've read this far that you give it a shot. A really good shot.
