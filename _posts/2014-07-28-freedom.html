<p>By some force we do not understand, we have the opportunity to consciously spend one life completely unbound and free to do anything. So why do we tend not to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the problem lies in the nature of freedom and how we react to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statistically, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_diamandis_abundance_is_our_future" target="_blank">we are living in the safest and most abundant period of human existence</a>. Freedom is a real choice the majority of the planet can make and one that everybody will be able to make in the near future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Freedom is uncomfortable.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freedom is unknown, which is scary. Here, there is no difference between a religious and non-religious person. Both live in fear of the unknown. Both cling to scriptures and templates to ease their discomfort in the unknown (the Bible, the Quran, BBC news, Fox news).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By following the voice of a higher power or an authority, you subscribe to an illusion of something known and tangible. You are clinging to safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Very few people actually want freedom. They prefer formulas.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether your formula is religious or logical, the drive is the same - eliminate the unknown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Freedom creates fear. People talk about freedom, but they are afraid. And a man is not yet a man if he is afraid of freedom</em> - Osho</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Be wary of any medium that uses fear. There is ALWAYS a hidden motive.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Religious organisations keep their subjects scared so that donations keep coming in and structure can be maintained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-religious media (news, TV, magazines) keep us scared so we keep subscribing to their product and buy other non-essential things - luxuries, technologies etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, by writing this, am daring you to wake up and choose not to be scared. To be courageous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word courage comes from the latin root - cor - meaning heart. To live a courageous life means to be living from the heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means recognising that you can sense what you want to do already. You can you let yourself explore and be drawn to whatever you feel is right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do this, and right and wrong do not exist. There is just you living your truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You cannot make a wrong a choice.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the courageous, every choice reflects their true nature. There is no such thing as a bad or a wrong choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something might not turn out the way you hoped, but the decision to do it in the first place came from your heart. On a deeper level, you will be more fulfilled than the ones calculating the odds of success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A person who is alive, really alive, vitally alive, will always move into the unknown. The heart is always ready to take the risk, the heart is a gambler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The head is a businessman. The head always calculates – it is cunning. The heart is noncalculating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Freedom is scary.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living courageously means being comfortable in not knowing things. The truth is, you cannot know for certain where you're going to be in a year's time, or in 6 months' time, or even this weekend. Anything could enter your life at any moment and derail your plans. Won't you be more joyful if you let them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brave person is fighting fear. Trying to suppress it as much as possible so it doesn’t get in his way. The brave person must constantly be on guard and use a lot of energy to suppress his fears, which will never go away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the courageous person welcomes the fear and uses it to his advantage. “Come on in, old friend” he says to his fear as he pours the tea, “we have many things to discuss”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>If it is scary, it must be worth doing.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living courageously is the only way to live life on your terms. It is the only way to unchain yourself of dogma and begin living consciously moment by moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the sense of fear as a test of whether or not something is worth doing. If it doesn't scare you or if it's something known - don't do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't know what's going to happen to you, if it makes you nervous, if it exposes you - you must do it.</p>
