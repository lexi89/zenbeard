<p>Masculinity is something separate from gender and something that everybody has to some degree. Anybody can be more masculine than feminine at their core but you will typically see that men are typically more masculine and women more feminine. These are just some of the principles that make up and drive the masculine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For convenience, the word "man" refers to a man with a predominantly masculine core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dancing with Fear</h2>
<p>Everybody has fears. However, whether a man succumbs to them, is up to him. To let fear triumph is to accept that external events can control him. The fact is that his reality is just that - <em>his</em> reality - his inner state bouncing back to him off external events like light off a mirror. If he is fearful inside, his reality<em> becomes</em> fear. There is no way to get rid of fear but his must learn to dance with her. He observes her, embraces her like he would his woman, and leads the dance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Decisiveness</h2>
<p>Decisiveness is the barometer for fear. We are attracted to indecision and procrastination because we mistakenly perceive it as being safe (<em>since we are safe right now</em>). An observer can quickly tell that a man’s indecision is reflecting how much fear he is experiencing in that moment. When indecision strikes a man, he senses what the underlying fear is and dances with her. He holds her hand and gently guides her in the direction he is headed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spontaneity</h2>
<p>A spontaneous man is one that is neither reliving past pains, nor waiting for some vision of the future. He is embracing the immediacy of the moment and the information that his senses are feeding him. The spontaneous man radiates joy and excitement, which naturally attracts positive people and events in to his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pushing the Edge</h2>
<p>A man's edge is found when he starts feeling the sourness of fear in his daily life and indecision flares up. When he has found his edge, he takes one long stride outside it and smiles because he is an explorer stepping in to the unknown. He knows that by not tasting the flavours of the world he is denying his lust for exploration and new challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Feminine</h2>
<p>In the same way that man yearns to see the colours of the world, he yearns for his polar opposite - the feminine. Masculinity and femininity collide and explode into every moment with uncontrollable attraction. To deny his love for the feminine is to deny the truth of his masculine sexual core. The attraction of the logical and transparent masculine to the chaotic and fluid nature of the feminine is inevitable and should be embraced, not blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Naked</h2>
<p>The incomplete man does not allow people to see his unique self because he fears that people won't like what they see. He is worried that if he reveals himself, he will pain those around him and feel pain from them. However, he can only cloak himself for so long. People can intuitively feel when he is not being himself and they will begin to distrust him and his words. Everybody has scars and darknesses (his are not special) but he has no time to be afraid of what people will think of them. The complete man sheds his masks, straightens his spine, and lets them see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Awake</h2>
<p>The complete man is not slave to his mind or ego. He can observe his thoughts from a distance and choose what serves his purpose and what doesn’t. He understands that his perspective and beliefs determine his reality, which he can shape at his will. Even in the darkest of times when the ego is complaining loudly at external events, he calmly observes its reaction and masterfully brushes it aside so he can get back to his mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Kind</h2>
<p>The awake man also knows that although everybody is capable of waking up, most have not mastered it yet. Because his thoughts are completely under his control, he must be kind and always help those who reach for help. The strength he has over his mind and spirit serves as a lighthouse for those wandering in darkness. If anybody needs help, he is there. Fully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Unbound by convention</h2>
<p>The real man knows that there is no trend, no group, no individual, no tradition, no religion, no obligation, and no convention that he has to follow. He can choose to follow outer convention if he wishes, but he does so because it serves him, not because it serves others. He can, for example, look up to a mentor or follow a tradition that shares his values but if they do not, he diverts his attention back to his mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Free</h2>
<p>The real man is, in every way, free. He understands that he is not dependent upon an employer, spouse, or institution. With his creativity and determination, the restrictions that others impose on themselves in geography, economy, and skill hold no power over him. He can masterfully commit his energies in any direction he chooses and overcome any obstacle that presents itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Whole</h2>
<p>For the complete man, work and intimacy are simply opportunities for him to show his gifts. He does not seek work or a partner to make him complete - he is already whole. His happiness is not determined by his work or his partner because he is already in bliss by experiencing the moment.</p>
