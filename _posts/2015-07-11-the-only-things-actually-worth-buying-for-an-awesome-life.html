<p>You want to "collect memories, not things"?</p>
<p>Thrive with just the bare essentials?</p>
<p>Never spend a single calorie on any fashion-related decision?</p>
<p>That's <em><strong>music to my ears</strong></em>, brother. Take a seat...</p>
<p>Living minimally is tough because most of the stuff out there isn't designed to last.</p>
<p>It's usually more profitable to design things that break down after a year so suckers like us have to get a new one.</p>
<p>But luckily, there is still a core of people who believe in quality and building things that are genuine investments.</p>
<p>It won't happen overnight, but what you're looking to do is collect a tiny amount of things that are: long-lasting, low-maintenance, and (preferably) multi-functional.</p>
<p>So, I've scoured through hundreds of brands, survival experts, and nomads to pick out gems that fit the bill.</p>
<p>Here's the list.</p>
<p>I'll keep updating this as new things come up so be sure to bookmark this page and keep checking in from time to time.</p>

<h2>Wallet</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.saddlebackleather.com/warranty">Saddlebackleather</a> make their wallets by hand and back it to last 100 years.</p>
<p>Or, you could back YOURSELF this weekend and <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/11/30/how-to-make-a-wallet/" target="_blank">make one with your bare hands</a> (instructions courtesy of <em>Art of Manliness</em>)</p>
<h2>Socks</h2>
<p>Yes, there is a place that makes socks that last a lifetime. You'll never go back.</p>
<p><a href="http://darntough.com/" target="_blank">Darn Tough</a></p>
<h2>Underwear / pants / boxers / tightey-whiteys</h2>
<p>Nine times out of ten, commando is fine. But sometimes, the mood just takes you, you know? These two rule the nest for low-maintenance, comfort, and hi-tech-as-fuck undies that last forever.</p>

<h2>Backpack</h2>
<p>Gotta carry your life-gear somehow, right? Why not use something that'll last a lifetime:</p>

<h2>Shoes</h2>
<p>A holy item. Choose wisely, and you'll have a pair for life. If Jesus was still around, he'd pick Rainbow Sandals.</p>

<p>Sandals: <a href="https://www.rainbowsandals.com/#">Rainbow Sandals</a></p>
<h2>Exercise / Yoga Mat</h2>
<p>People will come and go, but in your journey to body-mastery, your mat will stay forever. Getting yourself a durable, non-slip mat will not only make the small steps much more enjoyable, but new habits will be more likely to stick.</p>

<h2>Meditation pillow</h2>
<p>Mental and spiritual exercise is a lifelong practice and a good meditation pillow transforms the whole thing.</p>

<h2>Smart / Formal wear</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you're gonna have to sharpen up to meet the parents or get that funding for that thing you're making. Nothing better than a Mizzen + Main. Hi-tech formal wear designed by athletes. No sweat, no odours, no iron. The only shirt you need.</p>

<h2>Outdoor / adventure wear</h2>
<p>Deserves a separate post but generally speaking, these two brands stand the test of time and come with a solid guarantee:</p>

<h2>Notebook / journal</h2>
<p>Every great man throughout history kept a journal. What better choice than the simple black rectangle used by Picasso, Hemingway, and van Gogh?</p>

<h2>Survival</h2>
<p>There is only one thing Bear Grylls carries with him at all times. A fire starter. It's the life-or-death difference if you ever get caught in the wild. You'll have a fire going in seconds wherever you are.</p>

<h2>Umbrella</h2>
<p>If you're an umbrella kinda guy and want something that won't flip, feels solid, and will last, then you need a Davek. Plain and simple.</p>

<h2>Flashlight</h2>
<p>If you're already carrying an umbrella when there's 50% chance of rain, I've got news for you. There's a 100% chance of darkness. Everyday. Keep one of these solid sons o' bitches next to your keys and be a hero:</p>

<h2>Chargers</h2>
<p>This one's kinda specific to slick "4 Hour Work Week" types who want to work from anywhere. This will probably save your life more than once.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>The undisputed king of multi-tools and something that should be in arm's reach of every man on the planet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.leatherman.com/" target="_blank">Leatherman</a></p>
<h2>Kindle</h2>
<p>Can't say they're a life-long thing because they haven't been around that long. But you definitely need books and carrying them around is a pain in the arse. Needs to be included</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Last thought:</h2>
<p>If you, like me, give zero f**ks about <em>things</em> because you'd rather be out there making magic happen, then you're going to want to get used to investing in something that will outlive you and your children rather than buying soft, disposable crap.</p>
<p>Start small and build up a core over time. If you can't buy it, try to make it yourself. Sometimes, a DIY alternative lasts longer than factory made.</p>
<p>Either way, make sure you keep your belongings to a minimum and start thinking about what mountain to climb or ocean to cross.</p>
