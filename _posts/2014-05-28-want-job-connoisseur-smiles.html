<p>If you thought you'd heard it all... well... you haven't. We sat down with "Connoisseur of Smiles" and generally incredible human being, Rodolfo Young, to put career counselling tips to shame.</p>
<h2>Z: What was your first “real” job?</h2>
<p><em>Technically, my first real job was creating CAD architectural designs for a company my Dad consulted finances for. From that I moved on through working at a self-serve soup and salad bar, grocery clerk, and finally my first (and only) real 40 hour/week job working as a lead graphic artist for an educational software curriculum company - cubicles and all.</em></p>
<h2>Z: In one sentence, what is it that you do now?</h2>
<p><em>I’m a Connoisseur of Smiles - as a Heart Coach I get to remind people of the beautiful expression waiting to be seen and acknowledged within them.</em></p>
<h2>Z: Wow. How did you end up with this job?!</h2>
<p><em>Funny story actually - I got into the personal growth field originally through massage. In college I was known throughout my dormitory as the guy who could give a 2 hour shoulder rub.  Someone recommended I start charging, so I did. </em></p>
<p><em>One day, when a University Police officer was walking into the dormitory, I happened to be sitting at the front desk giving a girl a shoulder massage. He saw her pay me and came up and asked if I had a license.  I thought he meant a drivers license, I had no clue you needed a license to massage people.  He informed me that in the state of California if you accept money for a form of touch, and don’t have proper licensing, that it was considered Prostitution! I decided to go get the minimum licensing and ended up falling in love with the work. I continued on to certify in 21 different styles, teach many of them, open my own centers, travel the world speaking about holistics, and eventually evolved into a Heart Coach.  </em></p>
<p><em>So, short answer - I ended up here because prostitution didn’t seem a good long term investment.<br />
</em></p>
<h2>Z: What is the best part of your job?</h2>
<p><em>I get to witness people discovering themselves and quite often realize what it means to be SEEN for the first time fully.</em></p>
<h2>Z: What are the boring parts of your job?</h2>
<p><em>I often bring clients to Bali for week long immersions and there is a lot of admin work that has to be done to prepare things for them.  I’m not that fond of logistics. Luckily, I’m building a team to do all of the admin for me and now I get to focus solely on being in service to my clients.</em></p>
<h2>Z: Do you like Mondays?</h2>
<p><em>YES! I have a Skype date every Monday with my family to catch up that I look forward to.  It’s also movie night at the local yoga studio.  I’m normally not that much into the movies, but the community gathering is always great.  For the most part, there isn’t a “work week” here in Bali.  My work time is built around my yoga, dance, massage, and cafe chill time.</em></p>
<h2>Z: If money were no object, what would you do on a daily basis?</h2>
<p><em>Sit and connect with people, sharing about deep philosophical issues, life, and the heart. (It is kind of what I do now).</em></p>
<h2>Z: What advice would you give to someone who can’t decide on a career path?</h2>
<p><em>I would give this reminder - Alignment of your passions and your activity make work effortless and abundant.  It’s like when your having fun and time seems to fly by.  It’s because everything is aligned, so everything is supporting the process and path you are walking.  If you are at a fork in the road between which way to go on your career path, I say sit down and do something unrelated that excites you.  Sometimes, neither of the options we think we have are the path our heart wishes to align to, so do something your heart loves to do and a new possibility might just present itself.</em></p>
