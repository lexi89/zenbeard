<p>“There is no such thing as a “gift”. Choices lead to habits. Habits become talents. Talents are labeled gifts. You’re not born this way, you GET this way” - Seth Godin</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a mini frustration that keeps coming up throughout my life. How many times have you heard people say “he’s a natural” or “so and so has a gift” or “it’s in his genes”? I have found that this is the single most toxic and demoralising thing you can say in life. As soon as you hear it, your fear will never let go and ALWAYS bring this up as an excuse. Watching children growing up thinking that they're not capable of doing something is, to be blunt, a fucking travesty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can see how simpletons from the woods can believe that someone magically decides whether we are able or unable to play the guitar or draw or sing before we are born. But if you have read ANY autobiography of ANYONE you follow, at no point does the person EVER write “yeah, I can’t explain why I’m so good at [whateverthefuck it is], i guess i was just kinda born with it”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOBODY in the history of time went from zero to “freaking awesome” at any age without being “fucking awful”, “pretty shitty”, “decent”, “passable”, and everything in between. So do yourself a favour, if you’re pretty shitty at something, don’t be so harsh on yourself and stop comparing yourself to people who have gone through the next stages. And if someone tells you, “hey, you’re pretty shitty at this” say “yeah, I know. Go suck a bag of dicks” (or whatever gets them to leave you alone) and get back to doing your thing coz you’ve got a long way to go, amigo. Just don’t break the chain [link to other article] and you’ll get there in no time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rant. Over.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> writes short, logical, and inspiring snippets about how everyone is born an artist but it gets beaten out of us as we grow up. You should bookmark that shit.</p>
