<p>Medium is the beautiful baby of Twitter founders, Ev Williams and Biz Stone. There are many ways to describe it, but for me - it is simply the best platform for storytelling on the internet.</p>
<p>In an age where anyone can publish things that look like crap and read like crap, Medium separates the wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p>Medium lets anybody submit a story, without having to worry about the formatting - it is already perfect and will do your work justice.</p>
<p>People can curate collections of stories around a theme, which you "follow", and your homepage is a stream of stuff that YOU like to read.</p>
<p>Here are some quality must-follow collections:</p>
