<p>Don't you love it when someone explains something with the <em><strong>perfect</strong></em> analogy and you get it straight away?</p>
<p><em><strong>This</strong></em> is what makes an excellent teacher.</p>
<p>There are a BILLION places to learn online. But very few focus on the <em><strong>quality</strong></em> of the teaching.</p>
<p>And lets face it — there is nothing worse than your curiosity fizzling away because of a confusing explanation.</p>

<p>Everything here passes the grandma test. There are analogies, diagrams, examples, and illustrations to explain complex ideas and problems.</p>
<p>This list will be constantly updated as new suggestions come in.</p>
<p>If you know a site that passes the grandma test, <a href="mailto:alexey.yanovski1@gmail.com">email me</a>, and I'll link and credit you in the description.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse" target="_blank">Crash Course</a></h2>
<p>YouTube channel that breaks down <em><strong>big</strong></em> topics from economics, politics, astronomy, anatomy, and much more into bite-sized, well-researched, animated videos.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas" target="_blank">NewThinkTank</a></h2>
<p>This one's for <em><strong>fast</strong></em> learners. The videos are all-in-one explainers for coding, psychology, marketing, and a few randoms like cooking and hypnosis. FAST paced and challenging to keep up but great if looking for a refresher or you're ready to take on big challenges.</p>

<h2><a href="https://designschool.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva Design School</a></h2>
<p>THE resource for picking up design and branding from scratch. Tons of examples, just the right amount of theory, and an excellent in-browser app for practice.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/" target="_blank">Reddit - Explain Like I’m 5 (ELI5)</a></h2>
<p>The only one in the list that you will have to be careful with. Among the gems, there is plenty of misinformation. Here are some favourites: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3qxt0d/eli5_why_isnt_100_humidity_just_pure_water/" target="_blank">Isn't 100% humidity pure water?</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3ieifd/eli5_stephen_hawkings_new_theory_on_black_holes/" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking's new theory on Black Holes</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3h4llq/eli5_how_does_a_touchscreen_work/" target="_blank">How does a touchscreen work?</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/">Blinkist</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to non-fiction books, there's a very important thing to remember: <em><strong>not all of them are worth reading. </strong></em>It is important to get an accurate, human description of what a book contains before committing to reading it.</p>
<p>Blinkist is exactly that. The most popular non-fiction books summarised into 15-minute reads you can squeeze into a lunch break.</p>
<p>Think of it like an extended trailer for books. There's an annual subscription that is the best investment you can make for your productivity.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.blinkist.com/page19/" target="_blank">Page19</a></h2>
<p>Following on from Blinkist is their blog — Page 19. Its name comes from the fact that books are dropped, on average, by page 18. This is a condensed, free version of their app. Well worth subscribing to to get regular, practical, knowledge nuggets.</p>
