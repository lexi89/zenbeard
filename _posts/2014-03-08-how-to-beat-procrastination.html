<p>99 times out of 100, when we are mano-a-mano with a task or a project, we think about the thing in its entirety and the huge fuck-off list of things that need to happen between now and then. We've all been there and there's no shame in admitting that it demoralises you and triggers the fear (commonly known as procrastination). There is a simple and effective way of beating it and regaining control of your shit. Let me put it in language you will understand:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every project is like an IKEA flatpack assembly kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Hear me out)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end product looks unreachable and fancy as shit. Splinters aside, after an hour, they make you feel like Michelangelo. So howthefuck do you get there? You break it down to a chain of simple, manageable tasks that you could do with your eyes closed. All you have to do is <strong>not break the chain</strong> and boom, you’re a carpentry wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Tangent: if IKEA was around when Jesus was a carpenter, he would have been out of a job and history would be better off)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what you do once you’ve got a project in mind. Hang a calendar on the wall and get yourself a red marker (one of those chunky, satisfying sonsofbitches that you see in the movies). Grab a beer and figure out an easy, tangible thing you could do every day that would move you towards the end goal. 10 pushups a day, run for 5 minutes, read 5 pages a day, play guitar for 10 minutes, doodle 1 thing a day, whateverthefuck it is. Make it so easy a toddler could do it. I don’t want to see you setting yourself a challenge of running for an hour every day. Ain't nobody got time for that. You'll build up intensity over time - <em>be patient</em>. Every day you complete the simple task, walk up to that calendar and cross that day off. <strong>DONE</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the good part - now, <strong>all you have to focus on is to not break the chain</strong>. You've already eliminated procrastination and motivation! This is between YOU and THE CHAIN. It’s not about how inspired you feel, the quality of the work, or how motivated you are. <strong>It’s just about not breaking the chain</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks in, you’ll wake up, see that chain on the wall and give the procrastination gremlin a little pat on the head - "Better luck next time... Bitch. This is my show, now". This then gives you the confidence to increase the intensity and after 30 days, the habit has been engrained in your life and it becomes easier and easier to stick with the programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember - mastery follows consistency. Bruce Lee famously said: "<em>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who had practiced one kick 10,000 times</em>". Be that man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.s - since you're a modern man and you use apps and shit, there's a great little app that I would recommend for you in your procrastination conquest - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/commit/id473527073?mt=8" target="_blank">Commit</a>. You tell it what you're going to do every day and hit the big green tick button when you've done it. Watch that chain grow.</p>
