<p style="text-align: left;">Throughout history, there have been a lot of opinions about what attitude, values, and qualities a man should have to find himself and his purpose in life. Here are what I think are the greatest things ever said by man:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two questions a man must ask himself: The first is ‘Where am I going?’ and the second is ‘Who will go with me?’ If you ever get these questions in the wrong order you are in trouble – <strong>Sam Keen</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p>A man must stand erect, not be kept erect by others - <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The way of a superior man is three-fold: virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear – <strong>Confucius</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Life is too short to be little. Man is never so manly as when he feels deeply, acts boldly, and expresses himself with frankness and with fervor – <strong>Benjamin Disraeli</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one – <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Manliness consists not in bluff, bravado or loneliness. It consists in daring to do the right thing and facing consequences whether it is in matters social, political or other. It consists in deeds not words ― <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something in life - <strong>Winston </strong><strong>Churchill</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Men are like steel. When they lose their temper, they lose their worth - <strong>Chuck Norris</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship - <strong>Oscar Wilde</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do - <strong>Bob Dylan</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>You were born as a sacrifice - <strong>David Daida</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life - <strong>Charles Darwin</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A man can’t ride your back unless it is bent - <strong>Martin</strong><strong>Luther king Jr</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time - <strong>Mark Twain</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Money has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants - <strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no man living that can not do more than he thinks he can - <strong>Henry Ford</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s never too late to be what you might have been - <strong>George Eliot</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently - <strong>Henry Ford</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re not failing, you’re not trying hard enough - <strong>Jilian Michaels</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
