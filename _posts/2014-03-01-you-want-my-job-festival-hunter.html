<p>What is a Festival Hunter? We sat down with Rhi Davies, co-founder of <a href="http://thefestivalhunter.com/" target="_blank">thefestivalhunter.com</a> to find out how she created a job around her love of music festivals and hanging out with friends. Too good to be true? Nah.</p>
<h2>Q: What was your first “real” job?</h2>
<p><em>My first student job was “Brand Ambassador” for Bacardi Rum in London. I was responsible for sponsorship and brand visibility within the student community. Basically, I got paid to get people drunk (responsibly). My first “real” job was working in a marketing department for a digital media agency.</em></p>
<h2>Q: In one sentence, what is it that you do now?</h2>
<p><em>I manage and run <a href="http://thefestivalhunter.com/" target="_blank">thefestivalhunter.com</a> with some friends - we provide news and reviews of music festivals from across the world. It started off slow and small, like everything else, but now we get invited to review bigger and bigger festivals around the world.</em></p>
<h2>Q: How did you end up with this job?</h2>
<p><em>I have been addicted to live music and performance arts since I was a child. Growing up near the Glastonbury festival site meant that I was always surrounded by musicians and artists both big and small. I also spent some time helping organise several festivals in the UK and found it really interesting. I think, above all, it was the love for partying with friends in fields, beaches, and mountains! When we realised there was no authentic and accessible source of information on festivals online we decided to come together to change this.</em></p>
<h2>Q: What is the best part of your job?</h2>
<p><em>Getting invited to all these festivals is incredible and a dream come true but the biggest buzz is still discovering amazingly unique experiences - anything from a little known acapella singer at an intimate gig in a treehouse, to visiting a massage parlour run by giant prawns. The variety and madness of festivals is incredible. Also, you won’t believe some of the stories festival-folk have to tell!</em></p>
<h2>Q: What are the boring parts of your job?</h2>
<p><em>*cheesy quote alert* Only boring people find things boring. Yes, some things like pulling reports or website maintenance are less exciting but when you’re doing it for the sake of writing about cutting edge creativity in music and arts nothing is really ever that boring.</em></p>
<h2>Q: Do you like Mondays? (+why?)</h2>
<p><em>No, not if its been a big weekend. Other than that Mondays get a pretty bad rep, it's a chance to plan out the new week and start afresh from any of the previous week’s downfalls!</em></p>
<h2>Q: If money were no object, what would you spend your life doing?</h2>
<p><em>What I do now but BIGGER - travel the globe seeking out and sharing the most unique and exciting festival experiences. There are so many amazing festivals happening every day across the globe that people don’t know about and are waiting to be discovered - this is my dream.</em></p>
<h2>Q: What advice would you give to someone who is having doubts about their career?</h2>
<p><em>If you are having doubts about your career then you’ve got to face them. Sometimes, you need a change of approach that will clear them but if they are deeper set then its probably time for change! Nothing will get you fired up and motivated like quitting a job you’re not enjoying. The sense of liberation is overwhelming - you’ll have lots more energy and see beauty in life again.</em></p>
