<p>A "new" idea or thought is nothing more or less than a combination of old materials. It is impossible for you to imagine something that isn't a combination of things that you haven't seen, felt, or experienced before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bit like dreams, really. Dreams are creative replays of things you have seen, learned, or felt previously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the rate at which you come up with ideas is merely your ability to make relationships between these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark Twain put it quite well:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and curious combinations. We keep on turning and making new combinations indefinitely; but they are the same old pieces of colored glass that have been in use through all the ages.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, there are only two ways to "increase" your creativity. You can either increase your “materials”, which is done by exploring the world through your senses, or you can improve your ability to create relationships between materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although seeing links between objects can be practiced and improved to an extent, it is mostly an innate ability - we all had it as children - and doesn’t vary much from person to person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There is no such thing as an original idea</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">profound</span> implications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more you see, feel, hear, touch, and smell in the world, the more THINGS you can link together in your mind. Remember - linking things together is a natural talent that is programmed in to every human being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you are struggling to CREATE something, it’s not because you are incapable of making links between things, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> be because of something else. It turns out that this something is actually quite stupid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem lies in the question you ask Brain when you enter creative mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People usually look up and think “<i>Make me something new, Brain</i>” and then wait for a reply. This is usually followed by head-scratching (never helps but feels quite nice). Needless to say, because you're asking for something that doesn't exist, you're not going to get it. Obviously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>What can i make from what I have, Brain?</em>”. If you look at this, it is actually the exact same question but Brain won’t look back at you blankly. Instead, it will get to work and filter through everything you know in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Your brain is the best filter</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of your mind as a computer with a lot of files saved. The first question will return an error: “file not found”. If it doesn’t exist, it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second one will run a program that joins each file together one by one and shows you what it would look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary school teachers often use this exercise. Show a group of pre-schoolers a simple object like a pencil and ask them to come up with as many uses for it as possible. (You will be astounded at the amount of things you can use a pencil for).Unfortunately, as we grow up, we forget this exercise and our perception of idea generation changes for the worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a wonderful story that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity" target="_blank">Ken Robinson</a> often tells at his talks on creativity about the girl that was drawing:</p>
<blockquote><p>A teacher comes around to a girl’s desk and asks what she is drawing.</p>
<p>“God,” she says</p>
<p>The teacher is puzzled for a second and says “But nobody knows what God looks like”</p>
<p>The girl, without looking up replies "They will in a minute!"</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Limits and restrictions force creativity</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the more limits you set yourself, the MORE things you can “create”. The stricter your budget and the more limiting the requirements, the more fusions and iterations Brain has to go through. This is where the magic happens. It is when you restrict yourself unreasonably that Brain create remarkable things. Things worth talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Jobs famously said that the iPod should be completely controlled through ONE button. It was this outrageous limitation for the design team that forced them to create something of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remarkable</span> beauty and simplicity to fit the brief.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creativity is not something reserved for the few, it is a default innate ability in everybody. The greatest creators are the greatest explorers.</p>
