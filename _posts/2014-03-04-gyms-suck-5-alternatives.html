<p>Here's an stat for you: <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2012/01/four_out_of_five_gym_membershi.html" target="_blank">4 out of 5  gym memberships in the US go unused</a>. Yes, most of us are lazy, but the reason for this is actually much much deeper. The image most people see when they hear the word "gym" is a very negative one (bulky pervs, smell of feet, crappy music etc...). For $50 a month, these glorified hamster cages make you feel sick every time you hear the word "exercise".</p>
<p>Are you a hamster? Didn’t think so.</p>
<p><em>It's not your fault that you don't want to go to the gym</em>.</p>
<p>If you take sport, and take away the camaraderie, mental challenge, and fun out of it, what you’re left with is the soulless and lonely routine known as “working out”. I might be going out on a limb here, but fuck that. Here are some kick-ass alternatives that will leave you looking like Bruce Lee and not some deformed Popeye-looking muthafucker:</p>
<h2>1. Bouldering</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering" target="_blank">Bouldering</a> is a physically and mentally rewarding type of climbing that requires just shoes and chalk. Bouldering gyms, in contrast to normal gyms, are home to people who encourage and coach each other regardless of ability in the spirit of group progress. You will find total strangers shouting words of encouragement as you push yourself and test your limits. Bouldering works on your finger strength as well as your core and upper body, leaving you sculpted like a greek god before you know it. Essential for climbing is the ability to set unrealistic goals and maintain positive mental imagery and self-talk, which is why you'll find that climbers, as a group, are much better to be around than gym-rats.</p>
<h2>2. Squash (Tennis On Crack)</h2>
<p>Do not be deceived by its child-like name. Squash will burn your calories like a high-school chemistry experiment. A half-hour session in a squash court needs more energy than an hour on a hamster wheel AND you build up reactions that make Mr. Miyagi look like the local drunk. Squash is a great example of <a href="http://greatist.com/fitness/complete-guide-interval-training-infographic" target="_blank">High-Intensity-Interval-Training (HIIT)</a>, which is not only far superior to long periods of low-intensity exercise (a.k.a. jogging), but is also a great stress release, improves your flexibility, and hand-eye coordination.</p>
<h2>3. Yoga (The Ancient Art Of Being Incredible At Everything)</h2>
<p>Yoga used to be exclusively associated with housewives and reluctant husbands, however, it's coming in to Western mainstream and routine in a big way. Way back when, Yoga was what people used to reach the ultimate physical, mental, and spiritual state. The benefits are endless and varied - stronger core, better sleep, steamier sex, less stress, better breathing etc... Basically, all you need in order to reach peak condition is a yoga mat and leave Bulgy McSelfie to his bicep curls of loneliness. To get started, here is an <a href="http://www.mensfitness.com/training/endurance/top-10-yoga-poses-for-men" target="_blank">excellent short guide</a> to some poses you can try right now and see how difficult this shit is.</p>
<h2>4. Martial arts ("The Chuck Norris")</h2>
<p>Like Yoga, the martial arts are focussed on physical and mental mastery but with the added benefit of teaching you to protect yourself and others if shit hits the fan. There is a lot of choice here so <a href="http://www.buffalotkd.com/types-of-martial-arts.php" target="_blank">read up on one that suits your goals</a>. Here's a freebie: going crazy on a punching bag is the best hangover cure ever. Don't let anyone tell you different.</p>
<h2>5. Parkour (Running. But Better)</h2>
<p>Parkour is described as "the physical discipline of training to overcome any obstacle within one’s path by adapting one’s movements to the environment". It has exploded in the past 20 years with fanatics opening up training areas and clubs to make it easier for beginners to try out the adrenaline and freedom that comes with monkeying around your local area. Find your local parkour group and you’ll be surprised at how welcoming and helpful the community is! The coolest part: it's FREE. Go. Now. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jXqhAXeDGY" target="_blank">short video about the subculture</a> that's well worth watching.</p>
<p>Also, do me a favour - forward this to somebody you know who has a case of gym-o-phobia and needs to know it’s not their fault.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
