<p>My motto for this year: get shit done. Start, create, fail, grow, change - these are all things that have to happen. For the first time, I set myself some resolutions that address core reasons for procrastination and getting started. Here they are in order. Time to get shit done, my friend.</p>
<h2>1. Read a book every week</h2>
<p>Books are the most underrated life-hack. Seriously. Somebody out there has poured a TON of time over every word and distilled their whole philosophy down to 300 pages of dense, distilled, digestible man-wisdom. WHY WOULD YOU NOT READ THEM? If you're fond of the old "I don't have the time" excuse, check out <a href="http://mindvalleyacademy.com/store/philosophers-notes/get-more-wisdom" target="_blank">Philosophersnotes</a> and get shit DONE!</p>
<h2>2. Eat like you give a f**k</h2>
<p>The first step towards living YOUR life it to take control of what you eat. If you eat crap, you will feel crap. But eat like you mean it, and your body and mind will work wonders. If you're not thinking about what you're eating, this is the first thing you need to address that will have an immediate effect on your energy and creativity levels. I'm not talking rabbit-food every day, I'm talking cut the junk: less sugary drinks and less crappy snacks to begin with and take it from there.

<h2>3. Start</h2>
<p>This is a tough one. Your lizard brain will make every effort to stop you from taking this first step. Here's what it says: "Where you are now, you are surviving and you are safe. Do not change. Do not move. Survive." Look around, soldier. There is no threat. Get started and shut this voice up. The more you practice getting started, the easier it gets. In fact, over time, as you prove your success to yourself, the lizard voice gets quieter and quieter until there's nothing left and your projects and ideas start to manifest effortlessly.</p>
<h2>4. Put the hours in</h2>
<p>Better face it now, squire - you will have to put time in to something to make it happen. Conveniently, this is also a perfect test of whether you're looking at a project that is worth your time. If you have found the thing that you were put on this earth to do, you won't even think about the time it will take to achieve it. If you're worried and questioning whether it's worth putting the hours in, KEEP LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT PROJECT. It's out there waiting to be found.</p>
<h2>5. Laugh at perfection</h2>
<p>Perfection is boring. From my experience and observation, it is also THE most limiting factor to a human being trying to reach their potential. Schools and society reward perfection, but it is also the most common source of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. Perfectionism is also the awkward uncle of our fear of failure, self-doubt, and procrastination. Letting go of your desire for perfection will enable you to take on board criticism constructively, help you get rid of guilty feelings, and improve your relationships with everyone around you.</p>
<h2>6. Finish</h2>
<p>“<em>The only purpose of starting is to finish</em>” - Seth Godin. Every project should have an end date. Whether you’re starting a blog, starting a business, or picking up that hobby you’ve always neglected - SET YOURSELF A SHIP DATE. Finishing means feedback, iteration, and most importantly - starting again. You are being unfair on yourself by not setting an end date.</p>
<h2>7. Share results, not ideas</h2>
<p>Psychological tests have repeatedly proven that sharing your goals with someone makes them LESS likely to happen. When you share your plans or ideas, this tricks your mind in to thinking it is already done and you become less motivated to do #4 - put the hours in. If you’re thinking about getting in shape this year, keep it to yourself and share the results once the job is done. Don’t go around blabbing about how you’ve just joined a gym and have bought all the gear - the approval from the crowd will damage your chances of getting to your goal.</p>
<h2>8. Only drink great coffee</h2>
<p>Tea-drinkers, step aside. The coffee-folk are here to get shit done. If you, like me, get excited by the smell of coffee in the morning, then you owe it to yourself to start the day off with a hot, lovingly brewed, mug of mountain deliciousness. This year, try turning this in to a ritual - get yourself a percolator, take care of your beans, get a grinder, and start your day off in a way that would make your grandaddy proud.</p>
<h2>9. Stop making excuses</h2>
<p>Your lizard brain will give you every excuse in the book - you don’t have the time, you don’t have the money, you’re not talented enough etc... The thing all of your excuses have in common is that the end goal seems too big, too far away, or the way to get there is unclear. You’re smarter than this. <a title="How to Beat Procrastination – Don’t Break The Chain" href="http://www.zenbeard.com/how-to-beat-procrastination/" target="_blank">Break it down in to small, easy chunks</a> and you’ll be surprised at how much you can accomplish. Start off with learning 2 words of Mandarin while you’re on the toilet every day. Move it up to 5 words before you go to bed. All of a sudden, you’re a million miles away from your start point and the lizard is feeling stupid.</p>
<h2>10. Make time for things and people that matter</h2>
<p>Now that you’re in charge of your shit again, be sure to maintain the relationships that are important to you. Walking around feeling guilty that you haven’t been in touch with someone you care about feels crappy. Putting it off just makes it more daunting and makes you feel even more crappy. Best way to keep in touch is with small updates. Send a picture of something that reminded you of that person or send a small message that shows you’re thinking about them. You don’t have to write an epic novel every time you want to speak to someone - save that for the drink you’ll buy them when you get back.</p>
