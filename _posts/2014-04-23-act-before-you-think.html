<p>Before we start, let me get one thing clear. There are some professions that, without doubt, require you to think before you act. For example, if Presidents, bear trainers or rocket engineers started following their intuition in decision-making, we might be worse off. Bear-trainers probably don’t wish they had a bit more spontaneity in their life.</p>
<p>However, the rest of us, the “99%”, could definitely do with relying a lot more on our intuition and acting before we think.</p>
<p>Here’s why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Your brain will always make excuses</h2>
<p>Because we are wired to pick up on danger and threat, when you set off on a task that tests your limits, your brain will do everything to justify non-action. Recalling similar events in the past that didn’t turn out well, maybe even as far back as your childhood, stories you’ve heard, rumours etc... If you act before you think, these thoughts will relax a bit because you prove to yourself that there’s nothing to be scared of. Eventually, they just shut up and let you get on with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Thinking stops you from building your intuition</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p><a href="http://mindvalleyacademy.com/featured/what-is-intuition" target="_blank">Intuition can be trained and worked on, like a muscle</a>. You can teach yourself to be more aware of gut feelings and signs, which point you in the direction you already know you need to go. If you keep thinking about decisions, your awareness of these signs will not develop and you will be stuck in your own thoughts and non-action. Try to listen to your intuition as much as possible - you already have the answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. You will fall down and learn faster</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>You can learn by reading, you could learn by going to a class, or you could learn from a mentor. All of these work but they are painfully slow. <a href="http://i0.wp.com/fundersandfounders.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/how-to-learn-fast.jpg" target="_blank">The shortest route between you and making an impact is to learn by doing and taking big risks</a>. The more you fall, the more you learn, improve, and grow. If you welcome failure with open arms and keep getting up relentlessly, you’ll get where you need to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Decisiveness is a cornerstone of masculinity.</h2>
<p>No woman can stand a man who cannot decide what he wants in a relationship, no boss appreciates an employee who cannot decide for himself, and no employee will respect a boss who is flat-footed in a time of crisis. The type of men the world needs and respects are the decisive ones. The indecisive man waits and is deluded by the safety of non-decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. You will get more shit done</h2>
<p>Getting shit done is your reason for being, the meaning of life, and everything. The more stuff you create around you, for other people, for your loved ones, the more you discover of yourself. Men, you were put on this ground to make shit happen and make a difference. Stop asking “why” and get out there.</p>
