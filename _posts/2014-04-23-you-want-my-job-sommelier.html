<p>We're a little classy this week on You Want My Job. Prepare to feel the sharp pang of job envy for Lewis, a Sommelier for a Michelin-star restaurant in London.</p>
<h2>Q. What was your first “real” job?</h2>
<p><em>Working for Oddbins, the wine merchant, back in 2006. Pretty back-breaking stuff. Pushing huge trolleys full with wine and beer, by foot, to pretty much everywhere within a mile’s walk from the shop. It really helped me understand wine better though, despite the more physical side of being a wine advisor and sales assistant. I don’t think I’d have enjoyed any other retail work quite as much as I did working there.</em></p>
<h2>Q. In one sentence, what is it that you do now?</h2>
<p><em>I’m the assistant head sommelier for two of Jason Atherton’s restaurants in London, Social Eating House and Little Social. A sommelier is the guy you generally see walking around slightly swankier restaurants, helping guests choose what they’d like to drink to accompany their meals, as well as dealing with wine list development, controlling all the wine stock, liaising with suppliers and whatnot.</em></p>
<h2>Q. How did you end up with this job?</h2>
<p><em>After honing my hospitality skills with the awesome <a href="http://thehawksmoor.com/" target="_blank">Hawksmoor group</a> for almost 4 years, I wanted a new challenge and a role in a company where I could start afresh, help develop skills other than selling wine and talking to guests. My role is more managerial now, and lets me shape the place I work in a little bit more.</em></p>
<h2>Q. What is the best part of your job?</h2>
<p><em>Booze and food. I get to work with one of the most amazingly talented chefs I’ve ever met, Paul Hood. I spend a lot of my time pairing together various forms of alcohol with his food in combinations I think will bring out the best in both and raise the experience above what it’d be otherwise. </em>   <em>I also get a huge buzz out of giving people a “Eureka!” moment. Whether it’s discovering a new cocktail/spirit/wine they’ve never tried before, making them reconsider an opinion they had on such things before, or showing them just how well a simple combination of food and drink can make a meal a lifelong memory, not just throwing stuff down your gullet.</em></p>
<h2>Q. What are the boring parts of your job?</h2>
<p><em>Boxes. Same as back in Oddbins; boxes. A large part of my job is dealing with deliveries, which includes lugging them up and down flights of stairs, emptying the bottles from them, breaking them up etc. Other than that, the same as any job in hospitality I suppose; getting through quiet shifts, or ones where guests don’t seem to be drinking.</em></p>
<h2>Q. Do you like Mondays?</h2>
<p><em>I do. Working in a Michelin-starred restaurant, especially somewhere like Soho, means we’ll always have some decent numbers, guest-wise. It’s also a great day for joining in with the spirits trainings after lunch, where we get various brand ambassadors and producers coming in to teach us about various products, as well as getting to try high-quality booze for free. Monday’s also a great day for getting all those little odd-jobs done that you realise you have to do halfway through a Saturday dinner, but just don’t have the time.</em></p>
<h2>Q. If money were no object, what would you do on a daily basis?</h2>
<p><em>I love working for Jason, he’s one of the best restauranteurs in the world. But ultimately I’ve always wanted to have something to call my own. So, I’d spend more time focusing on my side project, which is a pop-up restaurant I currently do with my twin brother and best mates. We’re called <a href="http://www.thefatbear.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Fat Bear</a>, and are trying to bring great, regional American food to London, with proper craft cocktails at an affordable price. I’d open a dedicated site in a decent location, curate the best wine and drinks list in London, and spend as much time attending to the guests as I wanted, without having to slog through the hours of more menial tasks the job usually involves.</em></p>
<h2>Q. What advice would you give to someone who can’t decide on a career path?</h2>
<p><em>I'd tell them that they're not alone. It’s a problem I think almost everybody with the privilege of being able to choose their own career faces. I fell into my line of work more or less by chance, and lucky breaks. I always aimed to work for the companies I felt the most in common with and had respect for, and I think that’s something very important. Make sure you’re comfortable with the employer, regardless of what line of work it is, and you might be surprised how happy you are.</em></p>
