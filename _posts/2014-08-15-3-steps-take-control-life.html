<p>A year ago, I was losing the fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People were coaxing me to behave a certain way or do specific things with offers of acceptance and love. I was changing my desires and beliefs to fall in line with external rewards. Like a lab rat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is truly depressing to discover that your decisions are not entirely your own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, had I known that acknowledging this would set me on a path of exponential happiness and self-mastery, I would have done it sooner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Oh hindsight, you big tease. Stop it.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, there are no more walls or fences. The gate has been left open and I wake up with a sense of infinite possibility and hunger to explore and learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I want to pass on to you, dear reader, so you too can wake up and stand tall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 1. Identify who or what is influencing you now.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your brain responds to two things and two things only - pleasure and pain. <em>Pain is bad. Pleasure is good.</em> Influencing anyone revolves around these two primitive impulses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I need to convince you that my way is better than yours, I have to make my way seem more pleasurable than your way. For example, I could tell you that your way is good but then advertise an improvement (my way) or I could scare you in to thinking that your way is destructive and choosing my way will be your salvation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be aware of people trying to recruit you to their causes; be it religious, social, corporate (advertising, news, and entertainment), professional or academic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To live a life on your terms, to choose your <em>own</em> causes and direction, you have to be aware of where you’re being pulled and who’s doing the pulling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 2. Make a choice.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are surrounded by people who need your help and time. Their motives will vary: money, safety, their own goals (altruistic or not), etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally, it will come from a good place. Someone will try to help you because they genuinely have your interest at heart. While trying to change someone for the better might sound like a noble idea, it is still misguided. Nobody can know what you want. <em>Only you do</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to change someone actually comes from a place of <em>ego</em> - you want that person to be like you. If you respect that person and their journey, the only thing you can do is to live your alternative and let them choose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, once you have spotted all of the forces at play, you can take control by choosing what serves you and what doesn’t. If something doesn't sit well with you - <em>ditch it and don’t look back</em>. If it gives you a buzz and fuels you with energy - that’s a keeper. Keep doing this and eventually there will be nothing left but positive forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s on you to choose what serves you and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 3. Practice</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With your resistance to conformity, you can start to consciously choose a new self-image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practice spotting the influencers around you. Everything from the News you read, what your bosses or colleagues say, through to the advice from your loved ones. Some will be helpful, but most will not. It’s on your head to either listen to the ones that help <em>you</em> or yield to the ones that help <em>others</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep asking yourself - is this something I support? Do I really need this? Does this improve the world? Is this helping me become a better person?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With practice, control will be back in your hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How can you tell if it's working?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will seem as if you are looking out on life with a different lens. A lens that shows you the thoughts and motives behind actions and words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see that there are people who magnetically suck energy out of people and others who have found the same lust for life as you. and spread energy. These are the keepers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People will <em>always</em> try to buy your help with promises of love and rewards but when they see the control and strength in your eyes, they will stop bothering.</p>
