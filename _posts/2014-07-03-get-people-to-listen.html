<p>We use words to connect with people, explain things, and persuade, but the reality is this - if you’re doing<i> </i><em>any</em> of these while talking to me - neither me nor anyone else is listening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gossiping</h2>
<p>You are speaking ill of somebody when they’re not around. Not cool. Why? As soon as I walk away, I know that you will want to talk about me to someone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Judging</h2>
<p>It is very hard to listen to you when you're being judgemental. I know that as soon as I say or do anything you will be judging <em>me</em> and I, inevitably, won't be living up to your bloated expectations. Keep it to yourself, luv.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Being negative</h2>
<p>A negative voice is boring because it sucks positive energy and wasted empathy out of me. Negative voices are weak and lack any authority because the easiest thing in the world is to complain. It takes a powerful person to be positive in the face of adversity and challenge. Telling me how you're overcoming a problem - <em>that </em>is worth listening to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Complaining</h2>
<p>Coming up to me and complaining tells me you are too lazy to deal with your own issues. If this hits a nerve and offends you, good. You're waking up. Asking for help is humble and self-respectful which is the <em>opposite</em> of complaining. Stop whining about “the system” or your situation and start working on yourself. I am ready to help - just respect yourself enough to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Making excuses</h2>
<p>If you are making excuses it is <em>impossible </em>to listen to you because you are simply not taking responsibility for your own actions and you are choosing to blame others. Definitely not something that <em>anybody</em> wants in their life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exaggerating</h2>
<p>If you exaggerate to make a point, that's a red flag. It is difficult to listen to you because you are not telling it as it is. This is very close to lying and nobody wants to talk to a liar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dogmatism</h2>
<p>Please do not confuse fact with opinion. If you are trying to explain something to me with your opinion - that holds no weight. If you cannot back up what you’re saying, or if you’re not an authority on what you’re talking about, then please don’t just voice your opinion for the sake of it - I am <em>not</em> listening.</p>
