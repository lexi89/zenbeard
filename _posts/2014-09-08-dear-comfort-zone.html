<p class="p1">I’m sure you’ve noticed the distance between us lately.</p>
<p class="p1">You deserve to know why I have been acting so strange so here it goes...</p>
<p class="p1">It’s all my fault. It’s not you, it’s me.</p>
<p class="p1">I don't think I have been honest enough with you.</p>
<p class="p1">When we were re-watching <em>Friends</em> season 9 the other night, I kept thinking about that hike with our neighbours and how John kept pointing out penis-shaped clouds. I know you said you were tired and the rain kept dripping down your neck but if i'm honest, the only thing I remember is looking out for the next fluffy sky-throbber. When you got upset, it made me realise that we have reached a crossroads in our relationship. I was having so much fun that I completely forgot about the time and how cold it was.</p>
<p class="p1">Please don't get me wrong - you are such a wonderful person and I will always cherish the memories we created together. That weekend when we marathon-ed <em>Breaking Bad</em> will go down in history. I still can't believe how much pizza we ate together. I could barely squeeze out a poo by the end of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Problem is... I think I'm heading in a new direction now. I'm confused and I need some space to figure things out. There was a time when the <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> theme tune would send warm, comforting shivers down my spine but now it just reminds of how we used to eat leftovers from our room-mates' dinners because the local take-outs were closed.</p>
<p class="p1">I need some time to understand <em>what it is I truly want</em> from my one life.</p>
<p class="p1">You are perfect as you are and I am sure that you will find the man or woman of your dreams. Somebody who will re-watch the classics and cheer you on in those video games for the rest of your life. Please don't give up hope just because I let you down.</p>
<p class="p1">I think it is a good time to end things now because it has become clear that we want different things.</p>
<p class="p1">If I could give you one piece of advice for your next relationship - try not to be so clingy. I hate to break it to you but you're clingier than cling-film. I can't remember a single moment in our relationship when you weren't there with your opinion. I can't believe that after all those spirituality books, you've chosen "Let's not bother" as your mantra. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King stood up in front of crowds of oppressed black people and shouted "Let's not bother"? We wouldn't have Michael Jordan. Or Space Jam.</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, I think we're heading in two different directions and we're at different points in our lives.</p>
<p class="p1">I know you have found your passions already but I need to leave and find mine instead of adapting to yours.</p>
<p class="p1">I hope you understand that this is for the best.</p>
<p class="p1">With love,</p>
<p class="p1">Body</p>
