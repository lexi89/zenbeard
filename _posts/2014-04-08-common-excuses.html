<p>Excuses, in general, are born out of fear. Fear of failure, success, judgement, change, pain. The list goes on. Here are 5 of the most common excuses you will hear from your own mind as well as those around you and what to do about them.</p>
<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">1. I don’t have the time / too busy</span></h2>
<p>Everybody says this as if they’re busier than Barack Obama. It’s also typically followed by a detailed justification of exactly WHY they are too busy and “but no really, I’m just too busy”. Hate to be break it to you but we're all busy, my friend.</p>
<p>The clever fix for this is to change your language. Instead of saying “I don’t have the time” force yourself to say “It’s not a priority” (which is the truth about what you’re actually DOING) and see how it changes your perception. All of a sudden, the truth of “eating healthily isn’t a priority” stings a lot more than “I don’t have the time to eat healthily”, or “calling mum isn’t a priority” rather than “I don’t have the time to call my mum". You are being more honest with yourself about the priorities you are setting in your life and you’re not empowering things that are outside of your control.</p>
<h2>2. I don’t have the money / I can’t afford it</h2>
<p>The reason why you say this is because you’re not willing (yet) to make changes and be creative. More often than not, the problem actually lies in your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">resourcefulness</span> and not your resources. When did “where there’s a will, there’s a way” stop being true?</p>
<p>Don’t have enough money? Fundraise. Borrow from friends. Crowdsource. Budget. Cut unnecessary expenditure. Get smart about your finances. Sell the stuff you’re not using. Find a way.</p>
<p>You don’t have to get there tomorrow, you just have to be willing to change, learn, and put the time in.</p>
<h2>3. I don’t have the energy / too tired</h2>
<p>Outside of genuine medical reasons (visit your doctor), the most common roots of this excuse are your lack of movement and “exercise” or your diet. If you are unfit, you’ll most likely have low energy and what you’ll find is that doing a small amount of exercise in the morning will dramatically decrease levels of fatigue as well as boost your metabolism throughout the day. Resting more and increasing your caffeine intake is NOT energy.</p>
<p>P.S - don’t waste your life at the gym. You can actually <a title="Why Gyms Suck And 5 Alternatives" href="http://www.zenbeard.com/gyms-suck-5-alternatives/" target="_blank">enjoy breaking a sweat with these alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>P.P.S - I’m not going to go in to why eating food instead of synthetics gives you more energy, that shit’s just common sense, man.</p>
<h2>4. I don’t have the ability / not gifted / don’t know where to start.</h2>
<p>This excuse just doesn’t cut it any more. Nobody goes from being incapable of doing something to mastering it overnight. The root of this one is patience and #1 - “I don’t have the time” or, as discussed, the resistance to change. To help create a productive habit, <a title="How to Beat Procrastination – Don’t Break The Chain" href="http://www.zenbeard.com/how-to-beat-procrastination/">break down the task and don’t break the chain</a>. It’s a long way to the top my friend and it’s going to be a hell of a ride!</p>
<h2>5. I won’t make money doing [insert your dreams here]</h2>
<p>Let me break this down real quick. Before you’ve even set off on pursuing a direction, you have a fear of something that you might fear in the future. A FEAR of a FEAR. Of something that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hasn’t even happened yet</span>! That’s just fucking absurd.</p>
<p>The root of this is, again, resourcefulness and narrowed thinking. If you’re hurtling head first towards your dreams, nothing can actually stop you. There are always ways to make money while doing the thing you love (side jobs, related jobs, freelancing etc...) and even getting paid TO DO the thing you love if you’re feeling particularly resourceful. If you’re doing a job you don’t enjoy in order to fund your passion, remind yourself every single morning why you’re waking up and doing it.</p>
<p>Keep your head on, my friend.</p>
