<p style="text-align: center;">“I’m bored’ is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that you’ve seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you’re alive is amazing, so you don’t get to say ‘I’m bored.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Louis CK</p>

<p>Although there are many different types of boredom (bored at work, by a repetitive task etc..) I want to talk about the most criminal one of them all. That feeling of not having anything to do or what some of you may know as “thumb twiddling”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This mood is commonly felt on weekend afternoons spent aimlessly flicking through TV channels or refreshing your Facebook feed for the third time in a minute. Boredom is also a big factor in why young adults pick up <a title="Male Millennials – The Lost Generation" href="http://www.zenbeard.com/mind-mastery/male-millennials/" target="_blank">smoking, gaming, or masturbating ferociously. </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it feels like an escape from boredom, you end up just as bored afterwards as you were before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Louis CK is right though. Boredom is our denial of the vast flavours and possibilities in the world and in our minds. We live in an age when you can learn any skill for free, travel to any land, and create things more powerful (and more useful) than the rockets that went to the moon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You. Don’t. Get. To. Be. Bored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some tactics you can use to go from being this guy into being addicted to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. Manual evenings.</h2>
<p>This is my personal favourite. Whether you are a student or at work, you will spend most of your day using your brain to perform tasks detailed, mechanical, or creative tasks behind a desk. By the time you get home, your brain is fried and begging you to stop.<em> Try this</em>. For two weeks, block out workday evenings as time for tasks that require hand-skill (no, masturbating doesn’t count). Start off with something small - tidying your living space, rearranging your room, throwing out stuff you don’t need. Over time, that will feel too easy and, god forbid, you might enjoy using your hands for once. You could even upgrade to fixing stuff, trying something new in the kitchen, or repurposing broken stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Surround yourself with do-ers</h2>
<p>The energy of boredom is infectious. If you’re surrounded by people who are easily bored, you will get sucked down to their level. The biggest culprits to watch out for are your loved ones - partners are parents. Sense when their boredom is seducing you to join them and respect yourself enough to simply walk away. Instead, seek out those people that are highly charged and always doing stuff. You know the ones I mean. The ones that called you up and said, “hey let’s do this” to which you replied “I’m busy today”. Seek them out and let their energy light you up and bring excitement to your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Be irrational</h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for boredom is that people have a tendency to be too “rational”. Not in the “correct” sense, but in the “overthinking” sense. So much planning, thinking, contemplating... it’s BORING. For example, going on a trip isn’t a difficult thing to do. Get in a car, on a bus, on a plane, and go. We have a tendency to plan around it, talk about it, debate it, argue about it, and research it before we even get to the place. Before we even get there, we’ve already lived the experience out in our heads so vividly that there is no room for excitement when we get there. Try this. Get a map of your country. Hang it up on a cork board. Throw a dart at it and go to the place it lands. No matter what. You have the ability to transform boredom into exhilaration - acting irrationally is a wonderful step in the right direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Get offline.</h2>
<p>The most obvious but the most difficult one. If you have that nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you're spending a little too much time laughing at cats online, then this shock treatment might be for you. Start off with limiting mindless internet surfing to 1 hour in the evenings. It takes a bit of time, but you will gradually realise that there really is stuff out there that will bring you permanent joy - something that a computer screen can never give you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Make something.</h2>
<p>This is pretty advanced and I wouldn't recommend this until you've tried 1-4 above. One you've got your evenings back to work on your own shit, it's time to make the magic happen and make something. I'm not talking about inventing something revolutionary, I'm talking something small. Make a present for a friend, write a letter, make a mural on your wall, make an origami elephant, paint your laptop a different colour, make a lampshade out of cups, make a business plan. You get the idea. The awesome thing about these is that they last and will give you a sense of accomplishment every time you look at it. #lifehack</p>
