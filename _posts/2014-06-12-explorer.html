<p>For some, the word “explorer” typically conjures up large moustached men wrapped in bear skin battling the elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For others, it might mean backpacking across Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a few, it might mean hiking through a jungle in search of a rare frog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compasses, maps, goggles - all instruments of exploration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hear the word “explorer”, none of this comes in to mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A student <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>practising</em></strong></span> a foreign language</p>
<p>An astrophysicist <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>searching</em></strong></span> for cosmic answers</p>
<p>A developer <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>creating</em></strong></span> software that nobody has made before</p>
<p>A farmer <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>planting</em></strong></span> seeds</p>
<p>A gymnast <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>tumbling</em></strong></span> in the air</p>
<p>A buddhist monk <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>meditating</em></strong></span></p>
<p>A couple under a blanket <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>watching</em></strong></span> their favourite movie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the difference between these people? Aren’t they all <em>explorers</em>? Aren’t they all poking their toe in the water to see how cold it is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aren’t they all battling the elements of their world with their bear-skin and leather boots? Aren’t they all using instruments to learn more about the world?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The student <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>exploring</em></strong></span> the mystery of language.</p>
<p>The astrophysicist<span style="color: #ff9900;"> <strong><em>exploring</em></strong></span> the unknown void.</p>
<p>The developer <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>exploring</em></strong></span> the limits of technology.</p>
<p>The farmer <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>exploring</em></strong></span> new life and biology.</p>
<p>The gymnast <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>exploring</em></strong></span> the body’s potential.</p>
<p>The buddhist monk <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>exploring</em></strong></span> our relationship with the world.</p>
<p>The couple <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><em>exploring</em></strong></span> each other’s minds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truth is, we were all born as explorers. When I was younger, I imagined that babies couldn’t speak straight away because they were shocked by how much stuff there is to explore like a mountaineer silently observing the sun rise over the peaks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world can be your imagination, your environment, your talents, your body, your sexuality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is full of flavours and you have one chance to explore it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t you want to taste it?</p>
