<p>If you’ve arrived here, then your attention span is slightly higher than the rest of the internet population and you can do a little happy dance.</p>
<p>Take a moment to really appreciate this. You’ve clicked on something that isn’t trying to draw you in with some fancy marketing technique. You’ve clicked here because you, at your core, are still human.</p>
<p>And I’ve got news for you, human.</p>
<p><strong>You. Are. Brilliant.</strong></p>
<p>You might feel like you’re not but trust me - I’m an anonymous voice on the internet. You’re brilliant.</p>
<p>You are exactly where you need to be right now. There are no “rules” for living a happy life.</p>
<p>If you ever read something on the internet that claims there are, please remember - <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">these are written by people who are tasked with tricking readers to read their thing. Market research says that, on average, your attention span is that of a 5 year old, which then forces bosses to make writers write condescendingly digestible stuff in order to get your click.</span></p>
<p>Anyway... I digress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You are exactly where you need to be right now.</strong></p>
<p>There ARE things you can do to change how you interpret the world around you, how you approach happiness, and how you love.</p>
<p>But these are all processes. They take time.</p>
<p>There isn’t a single thing anyone can write in one blog post that can fix a part of your life instantly.</p>
<p>But do you hear what you’re doing right now?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>You are <strong>BREATHING</strong>.</p>
<p>You are <strong>INGESTING</strong> air and using it to feed yourself.</p>
<p>Your heart is spasming and pumping <strong>BLOOD</strong> around your body.</p>
<p>Your eyes are capturing light and giving your brain stuff to filter through.</p>
<p>Your hands are touching things and saving the information in your <strong>HEAD</strong>.</p>
<p>Isn’t that incredible? You know what that means?</p>
<p>NO?!</p>
<p>It means you can do <strong>ANY. THING</strong>.</p>
<p>You can have a milkshake. You can have a salad. You can learn to juggle. You can tell the barista that her hair looks great. You can make silly faces at the kid that keeps looking at you. You can walk 20 miles for a burger. You can build a home. You can fall in love. You can fall out of love. You can listen the rain. You can shout. You can find God. You can lose God. You can ask the baker to teach you how to bake bread. You can read comics. You can make confetti out of the comics.</p>
<p>You can figure out exactly what you want to do right now and do it.</p>
<p>You can feel exactly what you want to feel right now and feel it.</p>
<p><strong>You are brilliant.</strong></p>
<p>Damn it's good to be you.</p>
