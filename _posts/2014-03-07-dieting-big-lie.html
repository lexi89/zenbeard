<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dieting leads to temporary weight loss, yes. However, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sandra_aamodt_why_dieting_doesn_t_usually_work" target="_blank">95% of dieters regain their lost weight in 1-5 years with 40% of them actually GAINING weight from their start point</a>.</span></p>
<p>Hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain and your subconscious mind has its own idea of how much you should weigh (known as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis" target="_blank">Set Point</a>"). If you experience rapid weight loss, it doesn’t matter if you’re fat or thin, your brain interprets this as an attack on the system - starvation - and goes in to survival mode. Your metabolism slows way down and your muscles burn far less energy, making all efforts to burn fat far less effective and keeping the weight off almost impossible.</p>
<p>This reaction makes sense - as we evolved and food was scarce, survival depended on preserving energy and bodily functions so we were much thinner. When food was readily available, your body would gain weight in preparation for the next shortage. Food has never been as readily available as today - microwave meals, drive through fast food, meals in a bag etc... so it is no surprise that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm" target="_blank">childhood obesity has doubled in the past 30 years</a> and that <a href="http://win.niddk.nih.gov/publications/PDFs/stat904z.pdf" target="_blank">the US has NEVER been as fat as it is today</a>.</p>
<p>Dieting is a huge industry in modern times because of the mis-sold promise of staying thin forever. However, the ONLY way to do this is through learning to listen to your body. If you’re hungry - eat. If you’re not hungry - don’t eat. SIMPLE AS THAT. Over time, you will steadily return to your optimal weight and stay there for the rest of your life. <a title="Why Gyms Suck And 5 Alternatives" href="http://www.zenbeard.com/gyms-suck-5-alternatives/" target="_blank">Add any of these gym alternatives</a> and you’ll look and feel healthy with minimal effort and actually enjoy it instead of running on a hamster wheel.</p>
<p>There is an argument to be made that diets actually cause more harm than good in the long run. Often, dieting leads to weight obsession and eating disorders, especially in young people. 80% of girls aged 10 in the US say that they have been on a diet. When did it become OK to tell our children that they are not beautiful the way they are?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Men of the world - IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?</p>
<p>You don't have to tough on yourself if you drink a can of coke or have a bag of crisps, just don't do it all the time. Be a bit smarter about what you're putting in your body and you will return to your natural shape over time. And for Godssake don't teach your children that it's ok to live off soda, potato chips, and chocolate every day. That's just fucked up and you're better than that.</p>
