excerpt: Finding your passion is disempowering advice. Here's what you can do instead,
  which will bring you closer to your truth much faster
---
<p>Firstly, if you have ever been told to find your passion, you should consider yourself very lucky. Most young adults never receive this advice from their peers and they just go around “being employed” without asking why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are questioning what brings you joy, how you can give back to the world, and what makes you lose track of time, then you are already on your way to living a full and vibrant life. High five.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you, like me, have asked yourself these type of things, it is also likely that you too have experienced the frustration and disappointment that comes with not being able to answer such a simple question - “What Is Your Passion?”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear not, brother. You are not broken and soulless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is why the idea of “passion” or “purpose” is bogus and a neat little alternative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>“Find your passion” is disempowering.</h2>
<p>"Finding" your passion implies that it is over there waiting to be found like buried treasure and right now you are passionless and unhappy. When you think of it as a search, the situation you are creating is one of constant struggle. You will fight waves of resentment at your current situation, silently hoping that you will soon find the treasure chest that is your passion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth is, your passion is not a buried treasure and you are not some Indiana Jones wannabe looking for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Being passionate NOW unlocks the next step.</h2>
<p>Think of your ultimate life purpose as your core. The thing you were absolutely born to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That core is surrounded by layers of different mini-passions that are equally exciting to you when you're in them. In order to get to your core, you need to go through all of these other layers, shedding them as you go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that you can see your core from where you are now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the only thing you can see from where you are now, is your current layer. When you are trying to “discover your purpose” through thought or brainstorming or whatever, it is no surprise that you end up frustrated. It’s an impossible task! You're looking for something that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know that you are destined for greater things but you don’t know what yet. Your current layer is just a distant approximation of your core. And that is ok. Be comfortable in the unknowingness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, say your core purpose is to work in carpentry. However, since you don’t know this yet, you might have to first work as an accountant, then in sales, then own a business, then a spell as a designer, and only <em>then</em> find your way to carpentry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the internet age, this kind of career jumping is very common as you can enter and leave professions with ease if you're a passionate person. What it implies is that you have to inject passion in to what you’re doing NOW in order for the next layer to be revealed. If you’re working in accountancy but figuring out your core purpose is making you miserable, then you will be oblivious to the next step (in this case, sales).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stop trying to discover your true calling and start focussing on what you’re doing now.</h2>
<p>By completely absorbing yourself in what you’re doing right now, you will not only enjoy it more, because you have stopped thinking about the future, but also reveal your next step a lot quicker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you focus your attention and be passionate about what you’re doing right now, the only thing that will stop you from taking the next step will be your resistance to change and fear of shedding your current layer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each layer is meant to be lived fully to the point where it becomes empty, boring, and useless. Then you MUST discard it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>This is a sign of growth, but you might interpret it as a sign of failure.</h2>
<p>The more passionate you are about your current moment, the quicker you will move towards your true calling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can be fulfilled right NOW if you stop looking for your purpose. Enjoy your current situation fully, and once it has served you enough, be grateful for it and move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
