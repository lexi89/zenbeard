<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">No modern man is complete without sharp morning-after skills. Think about it. Before she has even WOKEN UP there is food on the table. What does this say about the man? He's reliable, unstoppable, and has his shit in order - that's what. Do you think she wants to wake up to Lazy McSnore-Face? Bitch please. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You think you’re the only one that likes waking up to the smell of freshly baked bread and coffee? Think again, my friend. If your mouth is watering, so is hers. Spoiling your partner with a cooked breakfast in bed is a treasure trove of man-points and a sure way to bag yourself some morning sexyfuntime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose a combination of any of these to guarantee yourself a spot in the good books:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fancy scrambled egg (Skill level: 3)</h2>
<p>Super easy and super tasty. Here's Gordon's recipe for extra <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/gordon-ramsays-scrambled-eggs-186294" target="_blank">pezaz</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hazelnut latte (Skill level: 1)</h2>
<p>Pimp out the simplest mug of morning black gold with a splosh of Hazelnut syrup and watch her eyes roll back with every sip. Just don’t tell her that it took you 30 seconds to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Squeezed orange juice (Skill level: Toddler)</h2>
<p>This little guy is the king of breakfast and a must-have on any breakfast tray. Get 3 oranges and squeeze them in to a cup. Don’t forget to sift out any pips - those unwanted bastards are sneaky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Strawberries and cream (Skill level: 0)</h2>
<p>No skill required. Grab a punnet of strawberries, cut the grassy tufts off and serve with a little cream. Tastes sexy and looks classy as hell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fresh pastries (Skill level: 4)</h2>
<p>The smell of pastries in the morning is enough to drive anyone crazy. We can cheat here a bit and get pre-made just-stick-it-in-the-oven mixes and make her think you run a French patisserie in your spare time. Ou la la.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Freshly baked bread (Skill level: 5)</h2>
<p>Grab some basic bread mix from your local store, pimp it out with some walnuts and dried cranberries and BAM you’re an artisan bread maker and all-round gentleman. Get yourself a monocle and grow a beard - you deserve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spanish omelet (Skill level: 6)</h2>
<p>Like an omelet but Spanish. And goddam do they know a thing or two about good breakfast. Chop up onions, green peppers, a clove of garlic, pour in your omelet mix and let the pan do its thing. Serve with orange juice and reap the rewards, you charming muthafucker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Smoked salmon with poached egg bagel (Skill level: 6)</h2>
<p>Any old Dick or Tom can poach an egg and it’s fancy as fuck if you can pull it off. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Poach-an-Egg" target="_blank">Watch this tutorial</a> and unlock the achievement. Toast 2 halves of a bagel, butter, smoked salmon strips, lemon drizzle, a sprinkling of dill and top it off with your poached egg and some cracked black pepper. Thank me later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing - don’t be a douche and leave the washing up to her. Wash up as you go and leave the kitchen in a good state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be a man, man.</p>
