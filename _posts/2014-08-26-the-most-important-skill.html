<p>Flashback time</p>
<p>Park. Handlebars. Bell. Helmet. Elbow pads. Parent. Focus. Pedals. Confusion. Betrayal. Euphoria. Liberation. Trial by bicycle was an emotional rollercoaster.</p>
<p>However, at this age we were taught the most important lesson we immediately forgot. 5 minutes later, we're racing around the park as if we've always known how to ride a bicycle. We have become self-confident. We have so much trust in our ability to ride a bicycle that we don't even question it once we can do it.</p>
<h2>Self-confidence does not come from positive wishing or positive hoping or positive thinking.</h2>
<p>It comes from having proven to yourself, over and over again, that you have what it takes to get from wherever you are to wherever you want to go.</p>
<p>Back to the park. Someone is holding that bike in front of you as you gear up to take the challenge. Remember that? That’s what we adults lamely call “goal-setting”. You were set the goal of riding a bicycle and you nailed it (unless you didn’t, in which case, this will be your first exercise).</p>
<p>Many people get turned off by “goals” because it can be seen to be coming from a place of desire or greed. It's much more profound than that.</p>
<h2>Hitting your goals is not the point.</h2>
<p>The point is to grow and experience something you never thought possible. It’s to look behind you and realise that nobody has been holding your bike for 50 metres. Goals are the mechanic by which we become the best version of ourselves. They are what keep us heading in the direction we've always wanted.</p>
<p>The habit of regular goal-setting and goal-achieving is probably more important than any other skill you could ever learn. They give you a sense of purpose, power, and focus.</p>
<p>OK, “grown-ups” have a harder time because things are a little more complicated with the mind being involved and all that.</p>
<p>There are a few more hurdles for adults because we have been repeatedly bullied in to wanting stuff, conforming, and feeling inadequate (kids actually had it pretty easy, wouldn’t you say?).</p>
<p>We have to do some prep to allow ourselves to take the bumps and bruises necessary to reach competency and the self-confidence that follows.</p>
<h2>3 things to address for a self-confident mindset.</h2>
<h2>1. Integrity.</h2>
<p>Sit down and determine your values. What do you stand for? Family? Friends?Equality? Fairness? Compassion? What do you stand against? Inequality? Unfair treatment of the vulnerable? Bullying? Fear-mongering?</p>
<p>Once you know your beliefs and values, by consciously being that person every day, you are building up your self-confidence. There are too many people who let their values slip because something that seems more important at the time gets in the way. The result? Not being able to recognise themselves in the mirror.</p>
<h2>2. Momentum.</h2>
<p>Taking more ACTION towards your goals instead of waiting for the “perfect” situation to get started. “I’ll do it this weekend”, “I am too tired in the evening”, or “I need more money”.</p>
<p>It’s the waiting that dampens your confidence because you’re at the whim of the world. Instead, say “what can i do right now to begin this?”. Sometimes it’s the first step that illuminates the rest of the path.</p>
<h2>3. Community.</h2>
<p>We ALL need people around us who are supportive, positive, and buoyant. As people are cheering you on and supporting you, it instantly gives you more confidence.</p>
<p>If you find yourself surrounded by stagnant or people, you don’t have to chop them off and get rid of them. Respect that they are on a different stage in their journey (one that you were probably at at some stage) but strive to create a peer group that will spur you on. Go to meetings, seminars, church, sports groups, whatever.</p>
<p>This is the easiest and most underrated way of instantly boosting your confidence.</p>
<p>With greater confidence in yourself and your abilities, you would set bigger goals, make bigger plans, and commit yourself to achieving objectives that today you only dream about.</p>
<p>Time to stop selling yourself short and take the reins again.</p>
