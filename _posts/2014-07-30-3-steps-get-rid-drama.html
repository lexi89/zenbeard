<p>What is drama? It’s all the crap you create in your own head. Stuff that doesn’t exist. Things that the ego makes up to get more attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you feel guilty or anxious, that’s drama. If you feel sorry for yourself, that’s drama. If you’re feeling cheated, depressed, hard done by - drama. It’s all in your head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Most people are in love with their particular life drama.</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>Their story is their identity. They keep telling it to themselves over and over again until their ego has hypnotised them in to getting its own way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ego believes that it can buy it what it wants if it complains enough. There is an unconscious belief that with enough negativity, it can preserve its identity as a whiny little sausage. What actually happens is, the negativity pushes you further away from any actual solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here’s the skinny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drama can ONLY enter your life when you are thinking about a future event or something in the past. You are either anxious about something that hasn’t happened yet, or you are resenting something that has f****d off already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution is to bring your attention back to “the moment”. All this means is being aware of and focussing on things that are happening immediately around you. Here's what you do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 1. Smell the drama.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing to practice is detecting drama. The good thing is, it is really obvious once you know the signs. You can tell when you or someone else is letting drama in by looking at the face. It’s the sour milk face - eyes narrowed, mouth curled down, head low (even your BODY doesn’t want drama).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even by simply being aware of the drama, most of the work is already done. You have already established that there are two people in the equation - your ego (the whiny sausage) and your observing self (the one actually calling the shots).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 2. Get back to the present</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>No matter where you are, amazing things are happening that we are taking for granted. From small things like coffee to big things like your family, your lover, or your child. Even the fact that what you’re reading right now means that a signal has been sent through huge wires under seas, oceans, and city streets to reach your screen. Isn’t that incredible? Isn’t that worth being thankful for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 3. Thank a Thing</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>Look at the thing you have just realised is amazing. In my case, right now i’m eating a peanut butter (chunky) sandwich. You don’t have to say it aloud, but at least take a second to give your unmixed attention and gratefulness to that one thing or person right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admittedly, I didn’t just thank my sandwich aloud because I’m in public and people are already looking at me funny. But I did look at it silently and appreciate how tasty it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it. Drama gone. Replaced with delicious things from the present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing is more important than what you're experiencing right now. Why? Because it's the only thing that you actually have. Past and future aren't real - you make it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cool thing is, once you do this enough times, you’ll start doing it on autopilot. Before you know it, drama will be replaced with a buzz from the good stuff that's happening right now. You might even notice people will start coming up to you and trying to figure you out. Just smile :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS - the feminine, being much more in-tune emotionally, is drawn to drama. To hear more about how to deal with dramatic women, <a href="http://www.maninsideshow.com/the-drama-antagonist/" target="_blank">listen to my interview</a> on the ManInside Show, where we debate the topic with the host, and alpha female, Anna.</p>
