<p>I've been a <em><strong>hardcore</strong></em> gamer since my early teens.</p>
<p>By hardcore I mean spending the equivalent of a <em><strong>full time job</strong></em> every week exclusively on gaming.</p>
<p>I devoted every spare hour to these guys:<br />
<em>DotA 1 and 2</em><br />
<em>World of Warcraft</em><br />
<em>Counterstrike 1.6 and Source</em><br />
<em>League of Legends</em></p>
<p>A lineup for a typical evening was a WoW raid, a CSS scrim, and a few casual hours of DotA in the early morning.</p>
<p>At school, I would discuss the previous night’s games with friends.</p>
<p>I would write dissertations on DotA heroes and study patch release notes for loopholes.</p>
<p>Even while working an <em>actual</em> full time job, I would still find ways to get a fix — flaking on weekend plans, lying to friends, sleeping less…</p>
<p>I didn’t go "pro", but I was well on the way.</p>
<p>On January 1st 2014, I can't explain why, I went cold turkey. I uninstalled <em><strong>everything</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I gave logins to friends, destroyed installation CDs, and started life from scratch.</p>
<p>Totally fresh. Level <em><strong>zero</strong></em>. The basics.</p>
<p>I found myself thinking:</p>
<p><em>How do you decide what you want to do?</em></p>
<p><em>Is there more to life than getting a job?</em></p>
<p><em>That guy seems so happy. How is he doing it?</em></p>
<p>After a few weeks, I admitted I had <strong>no fucking clue</strong> and got help.</p>
<p>I swallowed every piece of self-improvement material I could click on. Happiness, relationships, money, work/life balance, sex, everything...</p>
<p>Today, I’m a walking billboard for life transformation.</p>
<p>In the space of <em><strong>one year</strong></em> I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moved myself Asia for a job I <em><strong>wanted</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Learned to write, code, sell, design, blog, speed-read, market, advertise, and manage finances.</li>
<li>Worked with the smartest people on the planet.</li>
<li>Stopped eating and drinking <em><strong>crap.</strong></em></li>
<li>Got physically and mentally strong.</li>
<li>Met the love of my life.</li>
<li>Started an online magazine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking back, I can see that gamers are an interesting breed. They have an intuitive grasp on some very important life skills that I believe every human can aspire to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Fail like a gamer.</h2>
<p>When a gamer experiences a failure, his response is automatic - <strong>try again</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? Because there are no consequences to failing.</p>
<p>In fact, a typical gamer knows that failing is as much a part of the game as winning. No failure - no progress.</p>
<p>Yet in "real life", we tend to create consequences where there are none. We turn harmless potential failures into life-or-death situations.</p>
<p>Speaking in public, talking to a girl, and creating your art - three common things that have <em><strong>zero</strong></em> downside, yet we paralyse ourselves before we even start.</p>
<p>If we were all a bit more fearless, like gamers, I think the world would be a better place.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: Try to see failure as part of the game instead of focussing on made-up consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. The only difference is time.</h2>
<p>In a game, the only difference between someone who is level 15 and someone who is level 80 is the <strong>time they have invested in the game.</strong></p>
<p>Yet in the real world we are very busy comparing our early sketches with someone else’s masterpiece.</p>
<p>We compare our level 15 with someone else’s level 80.</p>
<p>Nobody is born a genius at Warcraft or Counterstrike.</p>
<p>Nobody is born a genius at anything - the key ingredient is <strong><em>time</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> The only difference between you and any “successful” person you can think of is that they showed up. Again and again. Day in, day out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Create your style.</h2>
<p>In the gaming world, <strong>nobody</strong> wants to be like someone else.</p>
<p>Everybody has their own setup, build, or modifications. You build your <em><strong>own</strong></em> rig, customise your shortcuts, and play the game <em><strong>your</strong></em> way.</p>
<p>If the game allows it, great. If it doesn’t - you find a way <em><strong>anyway</strong></em>. Name any game and you’ll see hundreds of 3rd party add-ons that lets you customise the game regardless of what's allowed.</p>
<p>Yet offline we do the opposite. The majority are scared of customising and creating the life they want. Instead, choosing something that has been done before. Something safe.</p>
<p>Again, we invent consequences to doing something that hasn’t been done before. We think we’ll be cut off, rejected, and hated.</p>
<p>Yet in reality, we <em><strong>love</strong></em> everything that is different. In fact, we love it so much we <em><strong>buy</strong></em> it.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> play the game YOUR way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s very easy to take the black &amp; white position - “people should play less video games and focus on life”.</p>
<p>But it’s difficult (and more rewarding) to respect and use the strengths of both.</p>
